				<p>My interest in music started pretty much from birth. My mother, a radio host, and my father, a musician, raised me in a house full of music. Music was always playing in my home growing up, whether it was my mom sorting through music and generating playlists, or my father rehearsing in his studio. I quickly developed a deep appreciation for music of all genres. Each genre can fit a different mood. When I’m working out I’ll choose an EDM playlist to pump me up and when I’m working on my writing I’ll play some jazz to fill the background. Artists have the power to transform simple lyrics to create so much more.</p>
				<p>Seeing an artist perform live is the best thing anyone can do for themselves. Live music is a whole different experience. I started attending concerts in my early teens and have been addicted ever since. Seeing and hearing an artist recreate their work on a stage right in front of you is a magical experience. There is a different energy when you’re in a crowd of people all dancing, singing, and enjoying the music you all came to hear. Over the years I have been to a fair amount of concerts and festivals. On this blog I share my own experiences, reviews, and provide you with essential tips for attending your own shows. Enjoy, and keep listening!</p>
