			<h1>FESTIVAL TIPS</h1>
				<h3>Festival Essentials</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>CamelBak Hydration Pack</strong>
					<p>Any sort of liquid holding backpack will do, but this one is my favorite. Absolutely necessary for hot, summer day long concerts or festivals. Easy hands-free hydration and less wasteful than buying a ton of overpriced water bottles.</p></li>
					<li><strong>Snacks</strong>
					<p>Any food available for purchase at festivals is always crazy expensive. Be cost efficient and pack easy snacks like granola bars, nuts, trail-mix, etc. </p></li>
					<li><strong>A Cheap Tent</strong>
					<p>If you're going to a multiple day festival that allows camping you're going to need a tent. It's highly likely that you, a friend, or a stranger will drunkenly break, dirty, or just completely trash your tent and you won't end up bringing it home. Save yourself and don't splurge on a nice tent; once you're at the festival you won't care anyway. </p></li>
					<li><strong>Entertainment</strong>
					<p>Festival first timers usually overlook the downtime they'll have when the music isn't playing. I never forget my ukulele when packing for a festival.</p></li>
					<li><strong>Baby Wipes and Hand Sanitizer</strong>
					<p>Festival bathrooms can be disgusting. Trust me on this one and make sure you've included these on your packing list.</p></li>
					<li><strong>Portable Phone Charger</strong>
					<p>The last thing you want is for your phone to die while you're searching for your friends or if you still haven't gotten that perfect photo.</p></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Basic Tips</h3>
				<ul>
					<p><strong>Wear comfortable clothes.</strong></p>
					<p>I'm not saying don't look cute, but definitely take weather and walking into account. If it's supposed to be hot, it's going to be extra hot dancing in a crowd of people, so plan ahead. Also, the last thing you want to be worrying about while you're jumping around is that painful, growing blister on your foot. Wear comfy shoes!</p>
					<p><strong>Grab a map or get the App.</strong></p>
					<p>Getting a map and schedule or downloading the festival's app ahead of time can be very helpful in planning your day. You don't want to miss your favorite artist because you can't find the stage or have the wrong set time.</p>
					<p><strong>Don't forget cash!</strong></p>
					<p>Many food trucks and vendors don't accept credit cards, so make sure you have enough cash for the weekend if you plan on buying stuff at the festival.</p>
				</ul>
